## Dev Commands

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm run start:dev                          # Start NestJS in watch mode
npx prisma migrate dev --name <name>       # Create and apply a new migration
npx prisma migrate deploy                  # Apply migrations in production
npx prisma db pull                         # Introspect existing DB into schema
npx prisma generate                        # Regenerate Prisma Client after schema changes
npx prisma studio                          # Open Prisma Studio (DB GUI)
npm run test                               # Unit tests
npm run test:e2e                           # E2E tests

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev             # Start Vite dev server
npm run build           # Production build
npm run lint            # ESLint
```

## Coding Conventions

### General

- All code, variable names, function names, comments, and database fields in **English**
- App UI text (labels, messages, errors shown to users) in **Spanish**
- Use `async/await` over `.then()` chains
- No `any` types in TypeScript — always define proper interfaces/types
- Use UUIDs for all primary keys (`@id @default(uuid())` in Prisma schema)

### NestJS (Backend)

- One module per domain entity — never mix business logic across modules
- Use DTOs with `class-validator` for all request bodies
- Use custom decorators to extract current user: `@CurrentUser()`
- Use `@Roles()` decorator + `RolesGuard` for role-based access control
- All responses go through a standard response interceptor `{ data, message, statusCode }`
- Never expose `passwordHash` in any response — use response DTOs
- All DB access via `PrismaService` injected into the module's service
- Never instantiate `PrismaClient` directly — always use the global `PrismaService`
- Never use `prisma.$executeRaw` unless absolutely necessary — use Prisma query API

### Prisma

- `schema.prisma` is the **single source of truth** for the database — never alter DB directly
- Run `npx prisma generate` after every schema change before coding
- Migration names must be descriptive: `add_player_photo_url`, `create_invitations_table`
- Never edit migration files manually after they are applied
- Use `@@map("table_name")` and `@map("column_name")` to keep DB names in snake_case while model names stay PascalCase/camelCase in TypeScript
- Always run `npx prisma migrate dev` in development — never `db push` (loses migration history)

### React + Vite (Frontend)

- Functional components only — no class components
- Custom hooks for all API calls (e.g. `useGetPlayers`, `useCreatePlayer`)
- Axios instance in `src/services/api.ts` with JWT interceptor
- Use React Query for server state management
- Use Zustand for global client state (auth, current academy)
- Component file naming: `PascalCase.tsx`
- Hook file naming: `camelCase.ts`

## Roles & Access Control

Four roles in the system. See @docs/PRD.md Section 4 for full permissions table.

```
saas_owner        → global platform access
academy_director  → full control of their academy
coach             → limited to their assigned teams
parent            → read-only, their child's data only
```

Role is resolved per-academy via `UserAcademyRole` table.
**Never hardcode role checks in controllers** — always use `RolesGuard` + `@Roles()`.

---

## Database Rules

- All tables use `uuid` as primary key — never auto-increment integers
- Every model has `createdAt DateTime @default(now())` — most also have `updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt`
- Soft deletes preferred over hard deletes — use `isActive Boolean @default(true)`
- See @docs/PRD.md Section 6 for the full schema

---

## Auth Flow

1. User logs in with email + password → receives JWT
2. JWT payload includes: `{ sub: userId, email }`
3. On each request, `JwtGuard` validates token and attaches user to request
4. `RolesGuard` checks `UserAcademyRole` for the current academy context
5. Academy context is passed via header: `X-Academy-Id`

---

## Critical Business Rules

- A user can have **different roles in different academies** — never assume one role per user globally
- A coach can be assigned to **multiple teams** within the same academy
- A player can have **multiple parents** linked to their profile
- Evaluation scores are **dynamic** — based on `EvaluationMetric` configured per academy, not hardcoded columns
- Invitations expire — always check `status` and `expiresAt` before accepting
- Parents only see data for **their linked child** — enforce at service layer, not just frontend

---

## Git Rules

- Always work on the current branch — do not create new branches or worktrees
- Do not commit automatically — leave changes staged for developer review

---

## Current Development Status

- [x] Project scaffolding (NestJS + React + Vite)
- [x] Prisma setup (schema, Neon connection, PrismaService, initial migration)
- [x] Auth module (register, login, JWT, roles)
- [x] Email verification flow (register, verify-email, resend-verification)
- [x] Academies module
- [x] Invitations flow
- [x] Invitations accept — email verification compatibility fix
- [x] Invitations — parent-to-player linking (playerId on invitation + auto PlayerParent on accept)
- [x] Schema update — add fields and team_schedules tables
- [x] Fields module
- [x] Teams module (depends on Fields module)
- [x] Players module
- [x] Attendance module
- [x] Evaluations module
- [x] Notifications module
- [x] Login screen (React frontend — Kinetic Edge design system, routing, auth store)
- [ ] Parent portal
- [ ] Settings screen
